## H7CTF 2025- Baby Sharingan 500 Write-up

![Title](images/Title.jpg)

### Step 1: Initial Analysis and Vulnerability Confirmation

We are provided with two sets of data: "Leaf Scroll" and "ANBU Report". üìú Each set consists of:

1.  An encrypted message (Ciphertext, `C`)
2.  A decrypted message (Plaintext, `P`)
3.  A "Chakra Signature" (presumably the key, `K`)

The name "Sharingan" (Copy Wheel Eye) and the presence of $(P, C)$ pairs strongly hint at a **Known-Plaintext Attack**.

The first step is to test the simplest hypothesis: a stream cipher using the **XOR** operation. If this hypothesis is correct, then the equation $K = P \oplus C$ must be true.

We can immediately verify this using Python. Let's take the first pair ("Leaf Scroll"):

```python
# P1: Decoded Leaf Scroll
p1 = bytes.fromhex("4b414b4153484920434f50494553204556455259204a5554535520484520534545532e")
# C1: Encoded Leaf Scroll
c1 = bytes.fromhex("03763f242b333d48701023217121112b31713c065279236767395317714c3f1a36604d")

# K = P ‚äï C
k1_calculated = bytes([p_byte ^ c_byte for p_byte, c_byte in zip(p1, c1)])

print(f"Calculated Key (hex): {k1_calculated.hex()}")
```

The script returns:
`Calculated Key (hex): 48377465787b7468335f73683472316e67346e5f72337633346c735f346c6c5f733363`

We compare this result with the provided `üîç Chakra Signature (Leaf Scroll)`: they are an **exact match**. This definitively confirms our hypothesis. The vulnerability is simple XOR encryption, and the "Chakra Signature" is the keystream.

### Step 2: Key Analysis and First Hurdle

Now that we know the "Chakra Signature" is the key, our goal is to find the flag. The flag is most likely hidden **inside the key itself**.

Let's convert the key we recovered (`k1_calculated`) from hex to ASCII to see what it contains.

```python
print(f"Calculated Key (ascii): {k1_calculated.decode('utf-8')}")
```

Result:
`Calculated Key (ascii): H7tex{th3_sh4r1ng4n_r3v34ls_4ll_s3c`

We see the beginning of the flag, but it's **cut off**. This is our first hurdle. The "Leaf Scroll" message was too short, and consequently, the key we recovered from it is also too short to contain the entire flag.

### Step 3: Automation and Breakthrough

There's no point in manually checking the second pair when we can automate the process. The problem with the first key was its length. The "ANBU Report" ‚ö° is longer than the "Leaf Scroll", which means its "Chakra Signature" (key) must also be longer.

This is our key to victory. We will write a full script to perform the same operation for *both* pairs and print both keys in ASCII.

#### Key Extractor Script (`solve.py`)

```python
def xor_hex_strings(hex_str1, hex_str2):
    """XORs two hex strings and returns a hex result."""
    bytes1 = bytes.fromhex(hex_str1)
    bytes2 = bytes.fromhex(hex_str2)
    
    length = min(len(bytes1), len(bytes2))
    xored_bytes = bytearray(length)
    
    for i in range(length):
        xored_bytes[i] = bytes1[i] ^ bytes2[i]
        
    return xored_bytes.hex()

def hex_to_ascii(hex_str):
    """Converts hex to ASCII, ignoring errors."""
    try:
        return bytes.fromhex(hex_str).decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
    except ValueError:
        return "[Error decoding hex]"

# --- Data from the challenge ---
c1 = "03763f242b333d48701023217121112b31713c065279236767395317714c3f1a36604d"
p1 = "4b414b4153484920434f50494553204556455259204a5554535520484520534545532e"
c2 = "1c7f31453b34243113113a267e33113d33662714376056647d383b7f6725201a3d674322613130341b7e3b2b56"
p2 = "54484520434f5059204e494e4a4120535452494b455320574954482053494c454e5420505245434953494f4e2e"

# --- Calculation ---
print("[*] Recovering Key 1 (Leaf Scroll)...")
key1_hex = xor_hex_strings(p1, c1)
print(f"    HEX:   {key1_hex}")
print(f"    ASCII: {hex_to_ascii(key1_hex)}\n")

print("[*] Recovering Key 2 (ANBU Report)...")
key2_hex = xor_hex_strings(p2, c2)
print(f"    HEX:   {key2_hex}")
print(f"    ASCII: {hex_to_ascii(key2_hex)}\n")
```

### Step 4: Execution and Flag Retrieval

We run our script and examine the output.

As we expected, the ASCII representation of the **second key** contains the full flag. (The extra `H7tex` at the end is just the keystream repeating, which confirms the nature of a stream cipher).

### Flag

Flag: `H7tex{th3_sh4t1ng4n_r3v34ls_4ll_s3cr3ts}`
